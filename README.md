### Data Science & AI Research Portfolio:

This repository serves as a technical annex to my professional portfolio, documenting my research and implementation of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision models.
As a Python Django Developer, I focus on bridging the gap between experimental data science and production-grade web applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure

# 🤖 Deep-Learning/
Focuses on Neural Network architectures for complex pattern recognition.

World Classification: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Intel Image Dataset to categorize environmental landscapes into six distinct classes (Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, Street).

Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colab (GPU).

# 📈 Machine-Learning/
Contains predictive modeling and statistical analysis projects.

Airbnb Price Predictor: A regression-based model designed to estimate property rental values. This project includes extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to identify market drivers.

Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

# 👤 Human Instance Segmentation with MediaPipe
This project demonstrates a high-precision foreground-background separation pipeline. It is a core component of my Virtual Fitting Room architecture, used to isolate human subjects from diverse backgrounds before overlaying virtual garments.

🛠️ Technical Stack
MediaPipe: Used for the neural network-based segmentation mask generation.

OpenCV: Handled color space conversions (BGR to RGB/RGBA) and image saving.

NumPy: Used for boolean indexing and mask manipulation.

Matplotlib: Provided visualization for the segmentation pipeline.
